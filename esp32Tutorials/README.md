## General Information
- I found [Paul McWhorter](https://www.youtube.com/c/mcwhorpj) on YouTube, his videos are easy to follow and understand.
- [Here is the playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJWR7dBuc18&list=PLGs0VKk2DiYw-L-RibttcvK-WBZm8WLEP)
- I'm using an esp32 not an arduino but so far it's working out.
- I also use w[Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) for some of the stuff I don't have.


## Acknowledgements
- Got the README template from [ritaly](https://github.com/ritaly/README-cheatsheet).
- Again, thanks to Paul and all that he does.
