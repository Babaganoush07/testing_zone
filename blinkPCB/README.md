# Blink PCB
> I really wanted to design a PCB and this is what I came up with. It's a copy of [this kit](https://www.amazon.com/Soldering-Electronics-Projects-Beginners-Electronic/dp/B017S00DJ2/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?gclid=Cj0KCQjwheyUBhD-ARIsAHJNM-N9SVTMwgUsSolK33_ot3CMvKtD43hRroDSQQUKsSgzvq0O3GrxCB4aAtQ6EALw_wcB&hvadid=580936993378&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9032638&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=16043670597574889874&hvtargid=kwd-410807753699&hydadcr=977_1014986911&keywords=solder+practice+kit&qid=1654355867&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&smid=A3GF6NL7EKJZCM&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExS0hMMFNKV0dFQkM0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTM2NjE2MTE5TUNNWTBURlc5RSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNjk0MDY5M0ZETzZQUFBUNDBMUiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) from Amazon.


## About the files
* There is a schematic for the circuit.
* A picture of the PCB.
* A zip file that contains all the info for the GERBER file.
* BOM for a list of materials.


## Technologies Used
- [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/editor) online editor.


## How to design to PCB
- I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/q9fgMhfEzko), and a lot of trial and error.

## How to Order
- Here is the [second video](https://youtu.be/SGsfiHOE9Fk) on how to order.
- There is also a txt file in the zip file that sends you [here](https://docs.easyeda.com/en/PCB/Order-PCB).
- This one was only $2.00 for a minimumm of 5 PCBs, but they get you with the $20.00 shipping.


## Acknowledgements
- Got the README template from [ritaly](https://github.com/ritaly/README-cheatsheet).
- Learned a lot from [VolosR](https://github.com/VolosR) and his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/VolosProjects).
